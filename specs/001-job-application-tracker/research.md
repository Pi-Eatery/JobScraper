# Research Findings for Job Application Tracker

## Testing
*   **Decision**: `pytest` for Python backend, `React Testing Library` and `Jest` for React frontend.
*   **Rationale**: Industry standards, good community support, and comprehensive features for unit, integration, and component testing respectively.
*   **Alternatives Considered**: `unittest` (Python built-in), `Mocha/Chai` (JavaScript).

## Performance Goals
*   **Decision**: Fast loading times (under 2 seconds for initial page load), responsive UI (under 100ms for user interactions), and efficient backend queries (under 500ms for API responses).
*   **Rationale**: Ensures a good user experience for a portfolio project and daily usage.
*   **Alternatives Considered**: More aggressive enterprise-level goals, but not necessary for this project's scope.

## Constraints
*   **Decision**: Single-user application, Docker containerization, cloud deployment (e.g., Cloudflare Tunnels), browser-based access.
*   **Rationale**: Aligns with the project's purpose as a portfolio piece and personal job tracking tool.
*   **Alternatives Considered**: Multi-user support, mobile app, desktop app – these are out of scope for the current feature.

## Scale/Scope
*   **Decision**: Supports a single user managing up to 1000 job applications.
*   **Rationale**: Sufficient for personal use and showcasing the application's functionality.
*   **Alternatives Considered**: Larger scale (tens of thousands of applications, multiple users) – these are beyond the initial scope.

## Observability & Monitoring
*   **Decision**: Structured logging with `Python logging` module and `React` error boundaries for frontend. Basic application metrics using Prometheus Node Exporter (for Docker container metrics) and Grafana for visualization. Cloudflare Tunnel logs for access monitoring.
*   **Rationale**: Provides essential insights into application health and performance without over-engineering for a portfolio project.
*   **Alternatives Considered**: Full-stack APM solutions, more complex distributed tracing – these are overkill for initial implementation.

## Continuous Delivery & Deployment (CD)
*   **Decision**: Git-based workflow with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing, Docker image building, and deployment to a Linux server via Cloudflare Tunnels.
*   **Rationale**: Aligns with DevSecOps best practices and provides a robust, automated deployment process suitable for a portfolio project.
*   **Alternatives Considered**: Manual deployment, simpler scripting – these would not showcase modern DevSecOps practices effectively.

## DevSecOps Best Practices
*   **Decision**: Integrate `Bandit` for Python static analysis, `ESLint` for JavaScript linting and security rules, `Docker Scout` for container image scanning, and regular dependency vulnerability checks (e.g., `pip-audit`).
*   **Rationale**: Implements shift-left security and supply chain security principles.
*   **Alternatives Considered**: Commercial SAST/DAST tools – these are usually too expensive for a personal project.
