# Feature Specification: Job Application Tracker

**Feature Branch**: `001-job-application-tracker`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want an app where any 1 user can log in and be greeted by a list of job applications. The user could filter this list with keywords and the like. All the job postings would be from verified good job boards to weed out potential scam job listings. This should be accessible easily and I want to be able to share it as a portfolio project along with using it for its purpose"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A single user can log into the application, view a personalized list of their job applications, and filter this list to find specific applications based on keywords or other criteria. The job postings displayed originate from credible sources, ensuring their legitimacy. The application should be straightforward to access and serve both as a functional tool for job tracking and a showcase project for the user's portfolio.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a registered user, **When** the user logs in with valid credentials, **Then** they are successfully authenticated and greeted with a list of their job applications.
2. **Given** a user is viewing their list of job applications, **When** they enter a keyword into a search field and apply the filter, **Then** the list of job applications updates to show only those matching the keyword.
3. **Given** a user attempts to log in, **When** they provide invalid credentials, **Then** they receive an error message and remain on the login screen.
4. **Given** a user is on the job applications list page, **When** there are no job applications to display, **Then** a clear message indicating no applications are found is shown.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user attempts to filter the list with a keyword that yields no matches? The system should display a message indicating no results were found.
- How does the system handle a user attempting to access features requiring authentication without being logged in? The system should redirect the user to the login page.
- What happens if the service for fetching job postings from "verified good job boards" is unavailable? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should an error message be displayed, or should the existing list be shown?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a single user to register and log in securely.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a list of job applications to the logged-in user.
FR-003: User MUST be able to filter the displayed job applications using keywords, status, date applied, and company.
FR-004: System MUST source job postings only from a predefined and maintainable list of "verified good job boards" to prevent scam listings.
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure accessibility for users, adhering to common web accessibility standards. (WCAG 2.1 AA)
FR-006: System MUST enable easy sharing for the purpose of a portfolio project (e.g., public URL for viewing).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents a single authenticated individual using the application. Key attributes include username, password (hashed), and associated job applications.
- **Job Application**: Represents a single job posting a user is tracking. Key attributes include job title, company, application status, date applied, link to original posting, and keywords. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What additional attributes are needed for a Job Application (e.g., notes, contact person)?]
