# Feature Specification: Job Scraper

**Feature Branch**: `002-job-scraper-the`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "job-scraper: The resulting dashboard from the app should be populated automatically with jobs from online job boards. They should only be available if they match keywords defined in the .env. The flow should be register > login > dashboard with jobs on it."

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: Which online job boards should the system scrape jobs from? ‚Üí A: LinkedIn, Indeed, and Dice
- Q: Besides title, company, and description, what other attributes should a `Job` have? ‚Üí A: Salary (optional) and Application Link (required)
- Q: How should the system identify and handle duplicate job postings? ‚Üí A: Based on the job title and company name
- Q: What actions can a user take on a job listed on the dashboard? ‚Üí A: Save for later, Mark as applied, Hide from view
- Q: How should the system behave when no jobs match the user's keywords? ‚Üí A: Display a message saying "No jobs found"
- Q: How should user passwords be stored? ‚Üí A: Hashed with a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2)
- Q: What level of logging is required for the application? ‚Üí A: Basic: Log errors and critical events
- Q: What is the expected response time for the dashboard to load with jobs? ‚Üí A: 1-3 seconds
- Q: What is the acceptable downtime for the application per month? ‚Üí A: Best effort for now, but 99.9% uptime in production.
- Q: What are the key metrics to define "Done" for this feature? ‚Üí A: All functional requirements implemented and tested, code coverage of at least 80%, and all acceptance scenarios pass.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to register and log in to the application to see a dashboard populated with jobs from online job boards that match my predefined keywords.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user, **When** they register and log in, **Then** they should see a dashboard with a list of jobs.
2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** jobs are scraped, **Then** the dashboard should only display jobs that match the keywords in the .env file.
3. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they visit the dashboard, **Then** they should see a list of jobs.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no jobs match the keywords? ‚Üí Display a message saying "No jobs found".
- What happens when the online job boards are unavailable?
- What happens if the .env file is missing or has no keywords?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to register for a new account.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to log in with their credentials.
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a dashboard to logged-in users.
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically scrape jobs from LinkedIn, Indeed, and Dice.
- **FR-005**: System MUST filter scraped jobs based on keywords defined in a .env file.
- **FR-006**: The dashboard MUST display the filtered list of jobs.
- **FR-007**: System MUST identify and filter out duplicate job postings based on the job title and company name.
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to save a job for later.
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to mark a job as applied.
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to hide a job from the dashboard.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: User passwords MUST be stored hashed with a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
- **NFR-002**: The application MUST log all errors and critical events.
- **NFR-003**: The dashboard MUST load with jobs in 1-3 seconds.
- **NFR-004**: The application availability target is best effort for now. In production, it MUST be 99.9% uptime (less than 1 hour of downtime per month).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents a user of the application, with credentials for login.
- **Job**: Represents a job posting scraped from an online source, with details like title, company, description, application link (required), and salary (optional).
- **Keyword**: Represents a search term used to filter jobs.

## Definition of Done
- All functional requirements implemented and tested.
- Code coverage of at least 80%.
- All acceptance scenarios pass.
